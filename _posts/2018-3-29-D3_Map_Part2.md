#### Part 2 - Using Data in the Map Visualization
In part two of this series, I will continue to work through visualizing New York City rat inspection data. This post will be about using the data to begin bringing the map to life. To see how the map was created, see [Part 1](https://bgentry91.github.io/D3_Map/) of the series.

#### Cleaning the data
The data comes from two sources - [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) and the [PLUTO database](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page), both as .csv files. I used Python and pandas to clean it initially and build my own .csv file that groups the inspections by quarter and census block. If you're comfortable with pandas and cleaning, I'd skip this section and move on to the next, where I use D3 to incorporate the data into the map.

First, I import the pandas and datetime libraries and pull in the data from both sources.
```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
df = pd.read_csv('PLUTO17v1.1/MN2017V11.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv("Rodent_Inspection.csv")
```

Now onto cleaning, beginning with the PLUTO file. First, I fill NaN values with zeros for the census tract field, converting it to integers, and then adjust the data to match the GeoJSON file. I also adjust the block group field to match the GeoJSON formatting. Finally, I eliminate any fields that I won't need later.

```python
df.CT2010.fillna(0, inplace=True)
df['ct_f'] = df.CT2010.astype(int)
df['ct_f'] = df.apply(lambda x: (str(x['ct_f'])+'00').zfill(6), axis=1)
df['cbg'] = df.apply(lambda x: 'Block Group ' + str(x['CB2010'])[:1], axis=1)
df = df[['Address','cbg', 'ct_f']]
```

For the inspection data, I had a bit more work to do. First, I am going to filter out the inspection type and borough and clean up the address to match the PLUTO data so that I can join them in a bit.
```python
df2 = df2[df2.INSPECTION_TYPE == 'INITIAL']
df2 = df2[df2.BOROUGH.isin(['Manhattan'])]
df2 = df2[df2.HOUSE_NUMBER == df2.HOUSE_NUMBER]
df2['ADDRESS'] = df2.apply(lambda x: str(x['HOUSE_NUMBER']).strip() + " " + str(x['STREET_NAME']).strip(), axis=1)
```

The next step requires a little helper function to map out the years and quarters, and then it's fun with lambda functions and datetimes to get everything in the format I want. Finally, I filter for only 2010 to 2018.
```
def convert_ym_2_yq(ym):
    l = ym.split()
    if int(l[1]) <=3 and int(l[1]) >=1:
        return l[0] + " Q1"
    if int(l[1]) <=6 and int(l[1]) >=4:
        return l[0] + " Q2"
    if int(l[1]) <=9 and int(l[1]) >=7:
        return l[0] + " Q3"
    if int(l[1]) <=12 and int(l[1]) >=10:
        return l[0] + " Q4"

df2['INSPECTION_DATE_TS']= df2.apply(lambda x: datetime.strptime(
                                    x['INSPECTION_DATE'], 
                                    '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p',
                                    axis=1)
df2['INSPECTION_MONTH'] = df2.apply(lambda x: 
                                    x['INSPECTION_DATE_TS'].month,
                                    axis=1)
df2['INSPECTION_YEAR'] = df2.apply(lambda x: 
                                    x['INSPECTION_DATE_TS'].year, 
                                    axis=1)
df2['INSPECTION_YEAR_MONTH'] = df2.apply(lambda x: 
                                        str(x['INSPECTION_DATE_TS'].year)
                                        + " " + 
                                        str(x['INSPECTION_DATE_TS'].month), 
                                        axis=1)
df2['INSPECTION_YEAR_Q'] = df2.apply(lambda x: 
                                    convert_ym_2_yq(
                                    x['INSPECTION_YEAR_MONTH']), 
                                    axis=1)
df2 = df2[df2['INSPECTION_YEAR'] >= 2010]
df2 = df2[df2['INSPECTION_YEAR'] < 2018]
```

Continuing to clean, I change the RESULT field to binary, filter out the fields I no longer need, merge the two dataframes, and aggregate the results by year and quarter. I need both a sum and a count because not only do I want to see the positive results, but I also want to see if a block was inspected that quarter. 

```python
df2['RESULT'] = df2.apply(lambda x: 
                        1 if x['RESULT'] == 'Active Rat Signs' else 0, axis=1)
df2 = df2[['ADDRESS','RESULT', 'INSPECTION_YEAR_Q' ]]
df3 = df2.merge(df, left_on = 'ADDRESS', right_on = 'Address')
df3 = df3.groupby(['cbg','ct_f','INSPECTION_YEAR_Q'], 
                    as_index=False).agg(
                                        {'RESULT':['sum','count']})
a = df3.columns.get_level_values(0).tolist()
b = df3.columns.get_level_values(1).tolist()
df3.columns = [m+n for m,n in zip(a,b)]
```

Although the dataset is large and I've aggregated by block and quarter, it is still relatively sparse. The mapping needs to have records for all of the months and blocks, even if they weren't seen - and if they weren't seen, they aren't in the data. To remedy this, I'll use a [cartesian join](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48255079/pandas-equivalent-of-sql-cross-join-cartesian-product) (my favorite type!) for all of the possible block and quarter combinations. To do this, I'll identify all the unique blocks and quarters, then perform the cartesian join. To then fill out the data, I do a left join from the cartesian result to my dataset (df3 in this case) and fill any missing values with zeros. 

```python
df_quarters = df2.groupby('INSPECTION_YEAR_Q', as_index=False)['RESULT'].sum()
del df_quarters['RESULT']
df_cb = df.groupby(['cbg','ct_f'], as_index=False)['Address'].first()
del df_cb['Address']
df_all = df_quarters.assign(foo=1).merge(df_cb.assign(foo=1)).drop('foo', 1)
df_combos = df_all.merge(df3, how='left', on=['INSPECTION_YEAR_Q','cbg','ct_f']).copy()
df_combos.fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

The last step to clean up the data is pretty quick. I wrote another helper function to identify the results of the inspections. 0 means there were no inspections for that quarter, 1 means there were failed inspections, and 2 means the block passed all of the inspections for the quarter. These are the actual results that will be plotted in the map. Then I clean up the leftovers a bit and turn my quarters into integers, as that will be a bit easier to deal with in D3.

```python
def b(failed,total):
    if total == 0:
        return 0
    elif failed >0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2

df_combos['RESULT'] = df_combos.apply(lambda x: 
                                    b(x['RESULTsum'],x['RESULTcount']),
                                    axis=1)

df_qn = df_all.groupby('INSPECTION_YEAR_Q', as_index=False).cbg.count()
df_qn.sort_values('INSPECTION_YEAR_Q', inplace= True)
df_qn.reset_index(inplace=True)
del df_qn['cbg']
df_combos = df_combos.merge(df_qn, on ='INSPECTION_YEAR_Q')
df_combos['Quarter_Number'] = df_combos['index']
del df_combos['index']
del df_combos['INSPECTION_YEAR_Q']
del df_combos['RESULTsum']
del df_combos['RESULTcount']
```

Last step is to simply output the data to a .csv.
```python
df_combos.to_csv('quarterly_rodent_data.csv')
```


All of this code can be found in this [python script](/files/D3/Cleaning_Part2.py) and the resulting .csv file can be found [here](/files/D3/quarterly_rodent_data.csv).

#### Data, meet Map
If you followed along on that last part, you should have created a 'quarterly_rodent_data.csv' file. I now use that in conjunction with D3 to visualize it! If you need the HTML file, it can be found on my [previous post](https://bgentry91.github.io/D3_Map/).

This part is actually surprisingly simple. All it takes is to use D3 to grab the .csv file, merge it with the GeoJSON, and then alter the fill function to fill the map.

Outside the d3.json function, I am going to import the .csv data. I also need to be sure to close this curly bracket after the code block that draws the map. I suggest doing this now so that you don't forget later (brackets can be a real nightmare for this stuff).
```
d3.csv("quarterly_rodent_data.csv", function(data) {color.domain([0,1,2]);
```

I also have to define the color object used above as a linear scale object in D3. Really, I'm just setting the colors to be mapped to the integer values that were created in pandas.
```javascript
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
              .range(['#b3cde3',"#810f7c","#2ca25f"]);
```
For the next step, I need to combine the inspection data with the GeoJSON - I actually am adjusting the json object in D3. This doesn't affect the actual GeoJSON file. I iterate through both files, but for now I am only going to look at the first quarter. I check to make sure the census block and tract match in both the json and csv objects and confirm that the record is in Manhattan. If all of the above are true, we set the value for that record in the json object to the value from the csv object and break out of the loop. This method is fairly slow as both the GeoJSON and the .csv files are fairly large and it has to be done every time the map is created. In the next post, I'll talk about another strategy to handle this. If you are a bit confused about where all this code goes, check the HTML file at the end of this post. For now I just want to go through the logic and try to keep the code as concise as I can.
```javascript
// Building new json file with associated rat/year_quater/location info
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {

    var datacbg = data[i].cbg;
    var datact_f = data[i].ct_f;
    var dataq = data[i].Quarter_Number
    var dataValue = data[i].RESULT;

    if (dataq == 0) {
        for (var j = 0; j < json.features.length; j++)  {
            var jsoncbg = json.features[j].properties.NAMELSAD;
            var jsonct_f = json.features[j].properties.TRACTCE;
            var jsoncounty = json.features[j].properties.COUNTYFP;
            //Matching census blocks
            if (datacbg == jsoncbg){
                //Mattching census tracts
                if (datact_f.slice(0,4) == jsonct_f.slice(0,4)) {
                    //Make sure it's in Manhattan
                    if (jsoncounty == "061"){
                        // Copy the data value into the JSON
                        json.features[j].properties[dataq] = dataValue; 
                        // Stop looking through the JSON
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, I have to update the fill function to take the new values assigned to each block.

```javascript
.style("fill", function(d) {
    var value = d.properties[0];
    var county = d.properties.COUNTYFP
    //If value exists and in manhattan
    if (value) {
        return color(value)}
    if (county == '061') {
        if (d.properties.AWATER == 0) {
            return color(0);
        }
        else{
            return "rgb(225,225,225)";
        }
    }
    else {
        //If value is undefined or outside MN, turn it white
        return "rgb(225,225,225)";
    }
})
```

And the map is filled in!

#### Legend and Title
The last thing that needs to be done is to create a title and a legend - no data viz is complete without them.

The legend is generally pretty easy, I just had to mess with the properties a bit to format it. Again, you probably won't want to change most of the properties except the formatting ones (data, width, height, transform, fill, etc). This will go inside the function where the object is being drawn. The text and colored squares are appended after the legend shape is drawn.

```javascript
// Building legend
var legend = d3.select("body").append("svg")
                .attr("class", "legend")
                .attr("width", 140)
                .attr("height", 200)
                .selectAll("g")
                .data(color.domain().slice())
                .enter()
                .append("g")
                .attr("transform", function(d, i) { return "translate(0," + i * 20 + ")"; });

    legend.append("rect")
          .attr("width", 18)
          .attr("height", 18)
          .style("fill", color);

    legend.append("text")
          .data(legendText)
          .attr("x", 24)
          .attr("y", 9)
          .attr("dy", ".35em")
          .text(function(d) { return d; });
    });
});
```

In order for this to work, I've had to define the legend text that is referenced above.
```javascript
var legendText = ["No Inspection", "Inspection Failed", "Inspection Passed"];
```
I also added some CSS styling:
```javascript
/* Legend Font Style */
body {
    font: 11px sans-serif;
}
        
/* Legend Position Style */
.legend {
    position:absolute;
    left:375px;
    top:500px;
}
```

Now there's a legend!

<img src="/images/D3/Map6.png" alt="Map6" style="width: 600px;"/>

Finally, I'll add a title. Pretty simple - just set a variable with the text to display and insert it into the body. This should go above the function that draws the object.

```javascript
var headline = "NYC Health Department Rat Inspection Results - Q1 2010";
d3.select("body").insert("h2", ":first-child").text(headline);
```

And with a title:

<img src="/images/D3/Map7.png" alt="Map7" style="width: 600px;"/>

The entire HTML file can be found [here](/files/D3/Part2.html).

#### Up Next
In part 3 I will create a slider to visualize the changes over time. Almost there!
